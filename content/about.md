<p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 first-letter:text-7xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-900 dark:first-letter:text-gray-100 first-letter:mr-3 first-letter:float-left">I've been building things on the web for over 10 years. I started with some blogs, games, articles, communities and products/startups. Since then I have collaborated with several cool projects and people. If you want my collaboration on a project, you can contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/whoisclebs" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline dark:text-blue-500 hover:no-underline">Linkedin</a>.</p>

            My journey in the world of technology began in 2012 when I had my first computer, I got it for Christmas (although it only arrived in February, yes, it was a sad thing when it came to online shopping). At that time I soon learned how to use servers to play some games with friends, it was an ugly fight between me, php and apache.

        <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Today, more than 10 years older, after changing my look (in the photo below you can see how I look today), city and friends, I still love playing with servers, but now I work with it in my daily life as a job, I'm a fullstack developer and I take a little risk with devops.

<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold dark:text-white">Hobbies</h2>
<p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me exploring adventures in other worlds (minecraft, genshin, league of legends), exploring fantastic universes and enjoying everything geeky. I'm a technology enthusiast, and my hobby is using my creativity to automate incredible things. And every now and then, when I'm missing a few screws in my head, I take the little time I have left and contribute to open source or participate in hackathons, I even have a collection of badges from the last hacktoberfest.</p>
