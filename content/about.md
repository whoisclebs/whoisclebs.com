# Who is Clebson?

I have created and broken things on the internet for over 10 years, i started with some blogs, games, articles, communities and products/startups. Since then I have collaborated with several cool projects and people. If you want my collaboration on a project, you can contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whoisclebs).

## Um pouco mais sobre mim

My journey in the world of technology began in 2012 when I had my first computer, I got it for Christmas (although it only arrived in February, yes, it was a sad thing when it came to online shopping). At that time I soon learned how to use servers to play some games with friends, it was an ugly fight between me, php and apache.

Today, more than 10 years older, after changing my look (in the photo below you can see how I look today), city and friends, I still love playing with servers, but now I work with it in my daily life as a job, I'm a fullstack developer and I take a little risk with devops.

## Hobbies

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me exploring adventures in other worlds (minecraft, genshin, league of legends), exploring fantastic universes and enjoying everything geeky. I'm a technology enthusiast, and my hobby is using my creativity to automate incredible things. And every now and then, when I'm missing a few screws in my head, I take the little time I have left and contribute to open source or participate in hackathons, I even have a collection of badges from the last hacktoberfest.

In this blog, I share my passion for programming, experiences in the geek world and my journeys in search of unforgettable adventures.

## CÃ³lofon

This website was designed and developed with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), ~~on a remote ssh machine [^1] accessing [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)~~ on a thinkpad e14. Generated statically with ~~[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)~~ Hugo. Styling is implemented with ~~[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)[^2]~~ and scss.

[^1]: At the time, my PC burned out its motherboard, so I ended up using a friend's laptop and sometimes even my phone.
[^2]: When migrating to Hugo, I haven't had time to get Tailwind up and running yet, but it's on the roadmap.
